# DevPotluck

Welcome to **DevPotluck**, a collection of scripts and snippets that I’ve found useful over time. These scripts are mostly written in Python, but you may find a sprinkling of other languages here and there. They’re small, focused tools—handy for specific tasks but not quite big enough to warrant their own repositories.

Think of this repository as a potluck: an eclectic mix of code for various needs.

- ** I'm refreshing the scripts here, so check back often (I'm cleaning them up a bit and will add them back when they're ready)

## About

This repository is a home for all the "small-but-mighty" scripts that solve real problems. Whether it’s automating a repetitive task, extracting data, or exploring a concept, you’ll likely find something helpful here.

While the scripts vary in scope and purpose, they all share a common goal: to make life easier for developers and tech enthusiasts.

## Scripts Overview

Here are some of the types of scripts you’ll find in this repo:

- **Automation**: Tools for streamlining workflows or repetitive tasks.
- **Data Parsing**: Scripts to process, clean, or transform data files.
- **Utility Functions**: Quick and helpful functions for everyday coding.
- **Explorations**: Proof-of-concept or experimental code.
- **Miscellaneous**: Anything else that didn’t quite fit in a category but is still worth sharing.

## Contributions

Although this repository is mostly personal, I welcome contributions! If you have a useful, small script that could fit the potluck theme, feel free to open a pull request. 

Guidelines for contributions:
- Include a clear and concise header comment or README explaining what your script does.
- Ensure the script is self-contained and does not require heavy dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- Maintain a clean and readable coding style.
